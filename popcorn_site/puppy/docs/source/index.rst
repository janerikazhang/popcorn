Welcome to the PuppyIR Framework Documentation
================================================

This documentation describes the PuppyIR project's open source, Python based, framework. This framework provides an open source environment for building information services, specifically for children, using a variety of tools, search engine wrappers, filters and more. 

In order to best describe the framework and its uses, the documentation is split up into several sections:

* the **'about'** section, which details the design of the framework and how the various components relate to each other;
* the **'using the framework'** section details various aspects pertaining to the usage of the framework;
* the **'tutorials'** section, which provides practical examples of using the framework for a variety of audiences;
* the **'extending'** section details how the framework can be extended to add new filters, modifiers and search engine wrappers; 
* the **'appendices'** section which details various supplementary materials that further expand on the other sections including an FAQ (frequently asked questions); 
* and, finally, the  **'API reference'** which details the components in framework (including details about their parameters etc).
